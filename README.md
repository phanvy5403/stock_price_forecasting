**Stock Market Prediction using LSTM model. The App forecasts Open price of NIFTY 50 index of the next five days using history of 10 days data as an input. Predictions are made using LSTM algorithms. After experiencing in 4 different LSTM models (with different architectures of model and structures of data), build the best LSTM model: multivariate encoder-decoder LSTM model with prior one weekâ€™s data as the input.
