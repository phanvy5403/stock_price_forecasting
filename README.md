**Stock Market Prediction using LSTM Models: The application predicts the opening price of the NIFTY 50 index for the next five days based on a history of 10 days' data. The predictions utilize LSTM algorithms. After experimenting with four different LSTM models featuring various architectures and data structures, we developed the optimal model: a multivariate encoder-decoder LSTM model using data from the previous week as input.
